# Law Diffs

A repo of selected laws with diffs visible.

Two types of stylesheets: (1) bills and (2) stats.

Key difference is whether the style of the `<ins>` and `<del>` elements are initially visible.

Documents in nepa/lbs always display `<ins>` and `<del>` on load.

Documents in nepa/versions displays the unstyled content of `<ins>` and does not display `<del>`. However, styled `<ins>` and `<del>` can be displayed by pressing the "Show Diffs" button. Pressing the "Hide Diffs" button returns the document to its original loaded state.
